# Silent Addons


This is a small Minecraft mod to Silent Gear from SilentChaos512, which adds a 5x5 AOE megahammer and mega excavator. There is a change with respect to the original 3x3 tools from Silent Gear: now it doesn’t make comparisons on the “similarity” of ore, it breaks adjacent blocks if it can break them. 
Crafting is handled with blueprints, which eliminate all recipe conflicts.
